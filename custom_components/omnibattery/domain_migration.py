"""Seamless migration of config + entity registry between integration domains.

Spike artifact: this is the orchestration that the *new* domain's ``async_setup``
will run once, on first start after the rebrand, to move every config entry and
its entity registry entries from the old domain to the new one **without**
changing any ``entity_id`` or ``unique_id``. Keeping those identical is what
preserves recorder history and long-term statistics (both keyed by ``entity_id``
/ ``statistic_id``), and avoids the ``_2`` suffixes HA would otherwise mint if a
fresh entry re-registered the same unique ids under a new platform.

It is deliberately standalone (not yet wired into ``async_setup``) so it can be
unit-tested in isolation before the rename is committed.

Recipe, per old config entry:
  1. If LOADED, unload it. ``async_update_entity_platform`` refuses to migrate an
     entity that still has a live state, so the entities must be torn down first.
  2. Create a mirror ``ConfigEntry`` on the new domain (same data/options/
     unique_id/source/version) but ``disabled_by`` set, and ``async_add`` it.
     ``async_add`` always calls setup, but a disabled entry returns early and
     loads no platforms — so the new entry exists without grabbing the entities.
  3. Re-point every registry entry of the old entry to the new platform +
     new config entry id, leaving ``entity_id`` and ``unique_id`` untouched.
     This must happen *before* removing the old entry: ``async_remove`` clears
     the registry entries still linked to it.
  4. Remove the old config entry, then copy the integration's ``.storage`` Store
     files into the new ``{domain}.{entry_id}`` key namespace (daily energy,
     accumulators, balance history) so persisted counters survive the rebrand.
  5. Clear ``disabled_by`` on the new entry. That reloads it, and now its
     platforms set up: ``async_get_or_create(new_domain, unique_id)`` re-finds
     the migrated registry entries and reuses their ``entity_id`` verbatim.
