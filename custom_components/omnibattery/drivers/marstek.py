"""Marstek Modbus-TCP driver.

Implements :class:`base.BatteryDriver` for the Marstek Venus family (v2/v3/vA/vD).
Owns the brand-specific knowledge that is currently spread across the coordinator
and control loop:

* which pymodbus timing/timeout/packet-correction a given firmware needs,
* the logical-key -> register/data-type mapping (``REGISTER_MAP`` + the per-model
  entity definitions),
* how a signed net power becomes ``force_mode`` + charge/discharge set-points.

This phase builds and unit-tests the driver in isolation; it is **not yet wired
into the coordinator** (no live behaviour change). Later phases route the
coordinator's connection, read and write paths through it and delete the
duplicated logic.
