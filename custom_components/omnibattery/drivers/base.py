"""Brand-agnostic battery driver contract.

This is the seam between the control layer (coordinator + ChargeDischargeController)
and the hardware. It is deliberately *semantic*, not register-shaped: the only
operations it exposes are "give me a telemetry snapshot" and "deliver this net
power". A Modbus/register battery (Marstek) and an MQTT/property battery (Zendure)
can both sit behind it because neither register addresses nor MQTT topics appear
in the contract.

Two model differences the contract reconciles:

* **Poll vs push.** Marstek is polled every ~1.5 s; Zendure pushes telemetry over
  MQTT. :meth:`BatteryDriver.read_telemetry` is a *pull* of the latest known
  state — a push-based driver caches the last message and returns it, so the
  coordinator's poll loop is unchanged.
* **Control semantics.** Marstek wants ``force_mode`` + separate charge/discharge
  set-point registers; Zendure wants an input/output limit. The control loop
  speaks a single signed *net power* (+charge / -discharge) via
  :meth:`BatteryDriver.apply_setpoint`; each driver translates to its own wire
  format internally.

Nothing imports this module yet — it defines the target contract. It is filled
in incrementally; see ``docs/plans/driver_abstraction.md`` for the phase plan.
