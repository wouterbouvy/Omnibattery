"""Unified charge-delay management for Marstek Venus.

Owns:
- Same-day delay latch persistence (dedicated ``charge_delay_state`` Store)
- The unified delay gate ``is_charge_delayed`` queried by the blocker registry
- The solar-forecast energy-balance decision (``_should_delay_charge``)
- The estimated unlock-time projection (``_estimate_energy_balance_unlock_h``)
- The per-day reset + proactive evaluation that keeps the sensor populated

The delay latch (``_charge_delay_unlocked``, ``_solar_t_start``,
``_delay_setpoint_reached``) lives on the controller because the weekly
full-charge manager bundles those same fields in its own Store for backward
compatibility, and the ChargeDelaySensor reads ``_charge_delay_status``
directly. This manager reads/writes those controller attributes by reference,
matching the existing extraction template.
