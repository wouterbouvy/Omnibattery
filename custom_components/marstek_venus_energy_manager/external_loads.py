"""Excluded-device and EV-charger load management for Marstek Venus.

Owns:
- Net kW correction to the home sensor for excluded-device accounting
- Power adjustment for excluded devices (applied before PD setpoint decisions)
- EV charger no-telemetry state detection and 5-minute battery pause logic

Reads/writes the controller's existing attributes by reference for backward
compatibility with the rest of the control loop:
    previous_power, _excluded_included_adjustment,
    _ev_charging_states, _ev_pause_until.
