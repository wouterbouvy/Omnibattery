"""Restore-state contract for the Zendure synthetic energy sensors.

Regression guard: the lifetime ``total_charging_energy`` counter must never be
zeroed just because the last persisted state was non-numeric. Zendure's single
connection drops often, so a restart's last recorded state is frequently
``unavailable``/``unknown``. The accumulator is now persisted as typed extra
data (``_SyntheticEnergyData``) taken from the entity object, not the state
string, and a malformed payload falls back rather than resetting to 0.
