"""Contract test: keep ``FakeCoordinator`` honest against the real coordinator.

The unit suite mocks the coordinator with ``FakeCoordinator`` (conftest). A mock is
only as good as its fidelity to the real interface: ``coordinator.available`` once
passed green against a ``SimpleNamespace`` while crashing in production because the
real attribute is ``is_available``. This test pins the class-level names the fake
mirrors (properties + methods) to the real coordinator, so a rename there fails the
suite instead of silently drifting.

Instance attributes set in ``__init__`` (data, battery_version, max_charge_power,
…) are not visible at class level and are not checked here; constructing a real
coordinator needs hass/pymodbus and is out of scope for the Windows unit suite.
