"""Shared pytest configuration for the Marstek Venus Energy Manager test suite.

The Home Assistant test harness comes from ``pytest-homeassistant-custom-component``.
Nothing here talks to real hardware.

Note: tests that use the full in-process ``hass`` fixture build a Home Assistant
event loop. On Windows that loop needs a local socketpair which ``pytest-socket``
(bundled with the HA plugin) blocks, so full integration-level tests are expected
to run in CI on Linux. The unit-level tests in this suite are deliberately written
without the ``hass`` fixture so they run everywhere, including a Windows dev box.

To opt a future test into loading the integration, request the
``enable_custom_integrations`` fixture provided by the plugin.

    The HA test plugin disables sockets before every test

    asyncio event-loop self-pipe uses an ``AF_UNIX`` socketpair (allowed); on
    Windows it falls back to an ``AF_INET`` socketpair, which the guard blocks —
    so the (session-scoped) event loop can never be built and any ``hass``-based
    test errors at setup. The plugin calls ``disable_socket`` by reference at
    runtime, so neutralising it here (before any loop is created) lifts the guard
    for the whole session. Tests in this suite do no real network I/O.

    Scoped to Windows only: on Linux/CI the guard works and is kept, so accidental
    network use is still caught there.

    typo — the real attribute is ``is_available``. That was the interface-drift
    hole: ``SimpleNamespace`` happily *wrote* the bogus name, so the later read
    succeeded and the test went green while production crashed.

    Reading an attribute that was never set raises ``AttributeError`` for free
    (ordinary class), so a production read of a wrong name fails the test too.
    This is intentionally *not* ``__slots__``: production attaches private runtime
    state onto the live coordinator (``_pd_write_count``, ``_hysteresis_active``,
    …) by assignment, and the fake must allow that exactly as the real object does.
