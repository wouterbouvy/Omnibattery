"""Regression tests for HourlyBalanceManager._push_sensors.

Pins the fix for #355: disabling the net-balance entity in the HA UI leaves it
unattached (``hass is None``). ``async_write_ha_state()`` then raises
``RuntimeError`` and, called from inside the PD control cycle, stalls the loop
so the integration status is stuck on "initialising". ``_push_sensors`` must
skip unattached sensors and still push the attached ones.

No hardware, no real Home Assistant: the manager is built with ``__new__`` so
only ``_sensors`` exists, which is all ``_push_sensors`` touches.
