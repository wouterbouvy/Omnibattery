# Marstek Venus Energy Manager

**Marstek Venus Energy Manager** is a custom Home Assistant integration to monitor and control Marstek Venus batteries (E v2/v3, Venus A and Venus D series) via Modbus TCP.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-battery-charging: **Dynamic power control**

    PD controller that keeps grid flow near zero to maximise self-consumption.

-   :material-calendar-clock: **Predictive charging**

    Automatic grid charging when the solar forecast falls short of expected consumption.

-   :material-battery-sync: **Multi-battery**

    Intelligent management of up to 6 batteries with optimal power distribution.

-   :material-tune: **Highly configurable**

    Time slots, excluded devices, peak shaving, weekly full charge and more.

## Key features

- **PD Controller (Zero Export/Import)**: adjusts battery power in real time to keep grid exchange close to zero.
- **Predictive charging**: three modes (time slot, dynamic pricing, real-time price) that charge from the grid only when the energy balance requires it. Uses a 7-day rolling average of real household consumption to decide whether grid charging is needed.
- **Multi-battery management**: smart selection with SOC priorities, energy hysteresis and efficiency zone operation.
- **Discharge time slots**: define time windows and per-slot target grid power levels.
- **Peak shaving**: reserves battery capacity to cover demand spikes above a configurable power threshold.
- **Weekly full charge**: charges to 100% once a week for cell balancing.
- **Cell balance monitor**: measures the voltage spread between the strongest and weakest cell after each full charge; tracks imbalance trends over time, sends alerts for moderate or high imbalance, and blocks discharge during the open-circuit voltage rest period.
- **Solar charge delay**: postpones morning battery charging (both solar and grid) while expected solar production is enough to cover the remaining energy needed.
- **Hourly net balance**: adjusts the PD setpoint continuously to keep hourly net grid energy at a configurable target (default: net zero per hour). Supports external net balance sensors and composes cleanly with all other features via the setpoint registry.
- **Load exclusion**: exclude high-power devices (e.g. EV chargers) so the controller does not try to compensate their consumption.
- **Proactive alarm notifications (v2 batteries only)**: monitors battery fault and alarm registers every 5 seconds and sends a Home Assistant notification the moment a new condition is detected, with the exact fault or alarm name. A system-level `System Alarm Status` sensor (`OK` / `Warning` / `Fault`) provides an at-a-glance view across all batteries.
