# Predictive charging — Dynamic Pricing mode

Automatically selects the **cheapest hours of the day** to cover the calculated energy deficit.

## Compatible price integrations

- **Nordpool**
- **PVPC** (ESIOS REE, Spain)
- **CKW** (Switzerland)
- **EPEX Spot** (e.g. aWATTar)
- **ENTSO-e** (Trnasparency Platform)

## Configuration

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Price integration type** | Nordpool / PVPC / CKW / EPEX Spot / ENTSO-e |
| **Electricity price sensor** | HA entity with the current price (and hourly forecast attributes) |
| **Max price threshold (€)** | (Optional) Price ceiling; does not charge even during "cheap" hours if the price exceeds this value. Also used as the discharge threshold when price-based discharge control is enabled |
| **Maximum contracted grid power ICP (W)** | Grid limit used to calculate required charging duration |
| **Only discharge when price is above threshold** | (Optional) Price-gated discharge — see below |
| **Solar forecast safety margin (kWh)** | (Optional) Extra energy buffer added to consumption forecast before deciding whether to charge (default 0 kWh) |
| **Predictive grid charge margin (%)** | (Optional) Tops up the grid-charge amount to hedge optimistic solar forecasts — e.g. a 2 kWh grid need at 50 % charges 3 kWh. Capped at the gap to max SOC (default 0 %) |

## Daily evaluation (00:05)

At 00:05 the controller:

1. Calculates the energy deficit (battery + solar vs. expected consumption).
2. Fetches today's hourly prices from the configured integration.
3. Selects the cheapest hours needed to cover the deficit.
4. Calculates and stores the **daily average price** from the hourly price profile.
5. Schedules the charging slots for the day.

### Retry logic

If price data is unavailable at 00:05, the system retries every 15 minutes for the first hour.

### HA restart mid-day

If HA restarts after the 00:05 window without a prior evaluation, the controller runs an automatic evaluation at startup (after 15 seconds) considering only the remaining slots of the current day.

## Price-based discharge control

The **"Only discharge when price is above threshold"** option adds an extra condition to discharge behaviour.

When active, **every controller cycle (event-driven)** checks whether the current price allows discharge:

```
If current_price > threshold:
    → Discharge allowed (PD controller operates normally)
If current_price <= threshold:
    → Discharge BLOCKED (battery holds)
```

The threshold is resolved as follows:

1. If **Max price threshold** is configured, that value is used.
2. If **Max price threshold** is empty, the daily average price is used.

The daily average price is calculated automatically during the 00:05 evaluation from the hourly price profile. The goal is to preserve battery energy for the most expensive hours of the day. If no fixed threshold is configured and the daily average is not available yet, discharge control does not act.

### Interaction with time slots

If discharge time slots are configured, **both conditions must be met** for the battery to discharge:

```
Discharge allowed = within_time_slot AND current_price > threshold
```

Outside the slot the battery never discharges. Inside the slot, it only discharges when the price is high enough.

### Effect on the PD controller

When discharge is blocked by price, the controller completely freezes its state (power to 0, no derivative term update), the same as during a time slot restriction. The battery resumes smoothly as soon as the price exceeds the active threshold again.
