# Marstek Venus Energy Manager for Home Assistant

The **Marstek Venus Energy Manager** is a comprehensive Home Assistant integration designed to monitor and control Marstek Venus E and C series batteries (v2 and v3) and Venus D and Venus A series batteries via Modbus TCP. It provides advanced energy management features including predictive grid charging, customizable time slots for discharge control, and device load exclusion logic.

## Key Features

- **Zero Export/Import PD Controller**: Keeps grid exchange near zero using a Proportional-Derivative algorithm.
- **Oscillation Prevention**: Deadband and derivative gain prevent rapid charge/discharge cycling.
- **One-Click PD Profiles + Quality Sensor**: Pick a tuning profile (Very smooth → Very aggressive) instead of tuning gains by hand; a control-quality sensor reports whether the result is stable, oscillating or sluggish.
- **Multi-Battery Support**: Manage up to 6 batteries with intelligent load sharing and SOC-based priority.
- **Predictive Grid Charging**: Automatically charges from the grid when solar forecast + battery won't cover tomorrow's consumption. Supports fixed time slots, dynamic pricing, and real-time pricing modes. An optional grid-charge margin (%) tops up the grid amount to hedge optimistic solar forecasts.
- **Time Slots (v2)**: Per-battery windows with independent charge/discharge ticks, optional SOC and power overrides, and a manual mode that forces a fixed charge or discharge power. Up to 8 slots per integration.
- **Weekly Full Charge**: Forces 100% SOC once a week for LFP cell balancing.
- **Solar-Aware Charge Delay**: Holds back grid charging while solar can still cover the required energy.
- **Peak Shaving**: Reserves battery capacity to cover demand spikes above a configurable power threshold, keeping energy in reserve rather than covering all consumption.
- **Load Exclusion**: Mask high-power devices (e.g. EV chargers) so the battery doesn't try to cover them.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Battery | Marstek Venus E v2/v3, Venus A or Venus D |
| Modbus bridge | Elfin-EW11 or compatible RS485-to-TCP converter — **Venus E v2 only**. Venus E v3, Venus A and Venus D connect via Ethernet with native Modbus TCP support. |
| Grid sensor | HA sensor measuring total grid consumption (e.g. Shelly EM3, Neurio, smart meter) |
| Network | Battery reachable by IP from Home Assistant |
| Home Assistant | Recent version (tested on 2024.x+) |
| Solar forecast *(optional)* | Sensor providing tomorrow's production in kWh (Solcast, Forecast.Solar, …) |

## Installation

**HACS (Recommended)**

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add a custom repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ffunes&repository=Marstek-Venus-Energy-Manager&category=integration)

Search for "Marstek Venus Energy Manager", install, and restart Home Assistant.

**Manual**

Download the release zip, extract the `marstek_venus_energy_manager` folder, copy it to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory, and restart.

## Testbed Configuration

- **Batteries**: 2× Marstek Venus E v2 and 2× v3.
- **Connectivity**: Elfin-EW11 Modbus to WiFi converter.
- **Metering**: Shelly Pro 3EM Energy Meter.
